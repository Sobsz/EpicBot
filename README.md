# EpicBot
the epicest laziest retrieval-based-est chatbot ever

basically "make your own cleverbot" except more stupider

epicbotâ„¢ is "inspired" by [project charlotte](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectCharlotte/)'s chatbots (tbh i just wanted to flex on 'em neural ni:b::b:as with the least amount of effort possible)

you'll need to save the training data manually by typing `/s` every so often

also `/help` for more wacky commands

example data coming whenever i feel like it's unbad enough to publish
